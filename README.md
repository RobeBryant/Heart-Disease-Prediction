# Heart Disease Prediction

The scope of this project is to predict the probability of heart disease in patients by using the dataset available via the UCI Machine Learning repository at this link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(heart)

The dataset is divided in:

* [Training features](/train_values.csv): training dataset with the values of the predictors for each patient ID
* [Training labels](/train_labels.csv): training dataset with only the label (heart disease present or not present) for each patient ID
* [Testing dataset](/test_values.csv): dataset that has only the values of the independent variables and is to be used to make the predictions that will be evaluated for the competition

The project is divided in the following sections:

* [1. Features Description](/Features.md)
* [2. Performance Metrics](/Performance_Metrics.md)
* [3. Exploratory Analysis](/EDA.md)
* [4. Correlation Analysis](/Correlation.md)
* 5. Logistic Regression Models
* 6. Random Forest Models
* 7. Penalized  Regression Models
* 8. Boosting Models
* 9. Neural Network Models
* 10. Ensemble Models
* 11. Conclusions

This project was developed as part of a Data Science competition.
